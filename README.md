a.k.a. Hitch hikers guide

A pseudo-intelligent agent that asks what you know through discussion of what movies you've seen, what books you've read, what mythos you believe in, and pins down how you talk about it: what vocabulary and sentence structure you use, do you focus on characters or themes ? what moral angle do you take on things?

Uses that lens to focus all of its output when you ask it questions about the world, takes some global dictionary (wikipedia in many languages is a good place to start) and answers questions in a way that makes sense to you.

Before the intelligence can be figured out, at least allow people to write monologues and polylogues about topics to get a more colloquial explanation and collective exploration of every topic
